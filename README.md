# Shiny-Application

This repo contains the applicaiton I have created using [Shiny. by Rstudio](shiny.rstudio.com) as a part of my Coursera study - Developing Data Products.

# Coursera assignment requirements:

The application must include the following:

- Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
- Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
- Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
- You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
- The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
